1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
  a. Dont allow access SSH from internet, If required then only allow specific IPs
   b. Change the account, may be disbale root account access via ssh. Create new account have root permission and have strong password or login via SSH KEY
2 Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
--> i think, we shoud create policy block access to secret recipes bucket/ or just allow from IP of admin instance.
