GuardDuty employs machine learning algorithms to establish a baseline of normal behavior within your AWS environment. Deviations from this baseline, such as unusual API calls, unexpected resource launches, or abnormal data transfer patterns, may trigger alerts.
GuardDuty analyzes CloudTrail logs to identify unusual patterns in API calls. For this case, if there's an unusual number of ssh failed login attempts, it might indicate a brute-force attack.(Guard Duty would have discovered it by using the VPC Flow logs,
 which have information about traffic going to and from the EC2 network interfaces.)
